# Readable

Readable is a toy single page web app built with React and Redux that allows users to make posts/comments and vote on them.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

In order to run the app you will need node, npm, and git installed on your machine.

You will also need to download the back end api that powers the app, and have it running at the url specified in [./src/config.json](./src/config.json) which is localhost:5001 by default.

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-readable-starter ./server
cd server

npm start
```

### Installing
